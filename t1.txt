Day 1 : Git Commands

git add                         ->    to stage changes
git commit -m "[some message]"  ->    to commit changes with a message to commit history.
git status                      ->    to check the status of your working directory and staging area.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


// commit history viewing
git log                         ->    See full commit history
git log --oneline               ->    Clean & short (most used 🔥)
git log --oneline --graph --all ->    With branch & merge graph (interview favorite)
git log -5                      ->    to view the last 5 commits

// soft reset : undo commit and keep changes staged
// hard reset : undo commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1         ->    to undo the last commit and discard changes.(1 can be replaced with any number to go back multiple commits)
git reset --hard [commit_hash]  ->    to reset to a specific commit and discard all changes after it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// after hard reset, you can use git reflog to find the commit hash and recover it
git log --oneline               ->    to view the commit history in short format.
6fd8337 little modification
0a89a0b Git command commit
e5db5f1 commit for 3 commands only

git reflog                      ->    to view the reference log of all your actions in git.
HEAD@{0} 6fd8337 commit: little modification   ← current
HEAD@{1} 0a89a0b commit: Git command commit
HEAD@{2} e5db5f1 reset: moving to HEAD~1       ← ⚠️ this is where we did hard reset
HEAD@{3} 54e92e5 commit: commit for 3 commands only once again
HEAD@{4} e5db5f1 commit (initial)

now you can revcover the commit by using git reset --hard [commit_hash]
git reset --hard 54e92e5         ->    to recover the commit we can do this.

git log --oneline        // now you can clealy see the out head moved to recovered commit 
54e92e5 (HEAD -> main) commit for 3 commands only once again
e5db5f1 commit for 3 commands only
